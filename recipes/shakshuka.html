    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Shakshuka </strong>is an easy, healthy meal in Israel and other parts of the Middle East and North Africa. It's a simple combination of simmering tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices and gently <a href="https://downshiftology.com/recipes/poached-eggs/." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poached eggs</a>. It's nourishing, filling and one recipe I guarantee you'll make time and again.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Vegetables</strong> - The base of shakshuka is a mix of sauteed onion, bell pepper, and garlic, along with tomatoes (I use a can of whole peeled tomatoes).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Spices</strong> -  The simple combination of paprika, cumin, and chili powder imparts incredible flavor. And the aroma instantly takes me back to meandering the spice souks in Cairo and Amman.
            <li>
                <strong>Eggs</strong> - The eggs gently poach in the spiced tomato mixture. You can cook them as long as you'd like for your perfect yolk texture. I personally prefer my yolks a bit runny.

            </li>
            <li> 
                <strong>Fresh Herbs</strong> - A sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley and cilantro not only adds a pop of green, but also adds yet another layer of flavor.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol> 
        <li>
            <strong>Suaté the vegetables:</strong> Dice an onion and red bell pepper and add that to a sauté pan with a little olive oil over medium heat. Stir the veggies for about 5 minutes, or until the onions become translucent. Then add the garlic and spices and stir for another minute, until the mixture is nice and fragrant.        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Simmer the eggs on top:</strong> Pour in a 28-ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes and use your spatula to break up the tomatoes into smaller pieces. Once this entire mixture is lightly simmering, you can crack your eggs on top. Use your spatula to make little holes for the eggs, then crack an egg into each hole. I use six eggs, though depending on the size of your pan you may use more or less. Reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5 to 8 minutes or until the eggs are done to your liking. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Garnish with fresh herbs:</strong>  A sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley and cilantro not only adds a pop of green, but also adds yet another layer of flavor.
