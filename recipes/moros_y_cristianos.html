    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Also known as <strong>Arroz Congri</strong>, this black beans and rice recipe is a staple of Cuban cuisine. Often served as a side dish or as a meatless meal, it is generously spiced and cooked with plenty of peppers, onions, and tender legumes to fill you up!
        For a little extra bulk and flavor for the vegetables, I start this recipe with crispy thick-cut bacon. That fat really sets the foundation for flavor! You can leave it out, though, for a vegan-friendly version of black <em>beans and rice</em>.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Thick-Cut Bacon</strong> - Cut a couple of slices into ¼-inch pieces that will mix well with the black beans and rice. To make a vegetarian variation of Cuban black beans, omit this ingredient. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bell Peppers</strong> - A combination of bitter green and sweet, juicy red peppers add lovely variance to this dish. Yellow and orange bell peppers are certainly fine to use as substitutes if desired, seasonal, or already rolling around in your refrigerator!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Black Beans</strong> - Don't drain the liquid! It adds extra, savory flavor to the rice as it cooks.
            </li>
            <li> 
                <strong>Sazon Seasoning</strong> - This spice mixture features the staples of Latin cooking: achiote, cilantro, oregano, cumin, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ground Cumin</strong> - Your closest substuties are corriander, chilli powder, or paprika. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>White Onion</strong> - This onion cooks down to a good texture and milde flaovour. Yellow onion is a good substitute, though it'll have a more significant texture. 
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol> 
        <li>
            <strong>Fry the bacon.</strong> Place the bacon in a heated Dutch oven or deep skillet, and fry until crispy. Once browned, transfer to a plate lined with a paper towel. Leave the fat in the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Suaté the vegetables.</strong> Add the chopped bell peppers and onion to the still-hot pan. Stir for 3 minutes. Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute until aromatic.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Season and Simmer.</strong>  Empty the can of beans, liquid included, into the pan. Follow with the rice, sazon seasoning, cumin, and 1 ½ cups of water. Drop the bay leaf in as well. Stir it all together and bring to a boil. Once a rolling boil is achieved, cover and reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add the Bacon & Serve.</strong> emove from the heat but keep the lid on for an additional 10 minutes. Uncover and remove the bay leaf. Fluff the rice and beans with a fork and stir in the cooked bacon.
        </li>
